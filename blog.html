<p>Date:7/10/17</p>

<p> My ideas about robotics changed because now I realize they are not just physical objects that move, they are just coded. I am excited about the future 
of robotics because with tech rapidly advancing there are sure to be more robots that do better and greater things.I also am a little nervous because
of the fear of robots taking over the world if they are programmed to do very advanced things.</p>
<p>I thought it worked well when we took turns putting the wires into the breadboard and playing around with their position. Things that didn'y work well
were when the led lights didn't work and we had to try a few ones.</p>
